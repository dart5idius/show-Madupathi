# SIDDHARTH MADUPATHI

I like the lord of the rings : return of the king. It's a high fantasy movie and the final movie in the same trilogy. I love it because it has meany breathtaking scenes, especially when aragon is giving a speech at the black gate, and overall the writing is impressive, and feels like a good conclusion to the whole story.
