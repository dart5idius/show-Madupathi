## Quotes that I like

> “And how have I lived? Frankly and openly, though crudely. I have not been afraid of life. I have not shrunk from it. I have taken it for what it was at its own valuation. And I have not been ashamed of it. Just as it was, it was mine.”
― *Jack London*

>“Truly great men must, I think, experience great sorrow on the earth.”
        ― *Fyodor Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment*
